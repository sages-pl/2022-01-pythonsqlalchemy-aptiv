English:
    1. Use regular expressions to check text [1] contains time in UTC (format: `%H:%M UTC`)
    2. Note, that this is slightly modified text than previously
    3. Check if text contains time in UTC (format: `%H:%M UTC`)
    4. Found match must be a valid time
    5. Run doctests - all must succeed

Polish:
    1. Użyj wyrażeń regularnych do sprawdzenia czy tekst [1] zawiera godzinę w UTC (format: `%H:%M UTC`)
    2. Zwróć uwagę, że to lekko zmodyfikowany tekst niż poprzednio
    3. Sprawdź czy tekst zawiera godzinę w UTC (format: `%H:%M UTC`)
    4. Znalezisko musi być poprawnym czasem
    5. Uruchom doctesty - wszystkie muszą się powieść

Tests:
